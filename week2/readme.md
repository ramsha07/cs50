## Week 2- Arrays
#include <cs50.h>

### 1- Compiling:
We know that compiler is one that convert source code into machine code that can be understood by a computer.
Last week we type in the command line interface `make hello`, it runs a command that executes clang to create an output file that you can run as a user. VS Code has been pre-programmed such that make will run numerous command line arguments along with clang for your convenience as a user.
Now, `clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50`. This will enable the compiler to access the cs50.h library.We are using this command to understand more deeply the process and concept of compiling code, using `make` in CS50 is perfectly fine and the expectation!

### 2- Steps of compiling:
Compiling involves major steps, including the following:
* **First, `preprocessing` is where the header files in your code, designated by a # (such as #include \<cs50.h\>) are effectively copied and pasted into your file. During this step, the code from cs50.h is copied into your program. Similarly, just as your code contains #include \<stdio.h\>, code contained within stdio.h somewhere on your computer is copied to your program. 

* **Second, `compiling` is where your program is converted into assembly code

* **Third, assembling involves the compiler converting your assembly code into machine code, i.e zeros and ones.

* **Finally, during the linking step, code from your included libraries are converted also into machine code and combined with your code. The final executable file is then outputted.

### 3- Debugging:
Everyone will make mistakes while coding. consider an example from the last week of printing the `3` bricks each on a new line 
````c
 for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        printf("#\n");
    }
````c
In the above code mistakenly i have typed the operator `<=` instead of just `<`. Running this code, four bricks appear instead of the intended three.
printf is a very useful way of debugging your code. You could modify your code as follows:
````c
for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        printf("i is %i\n", i);
        printf("#\n");
    }
````
Running this code, you will see numerous statements, including i is 0, i is 1, i is 2, and i is 3. Seeing this, you might realize that Further code needs to be corrected to print only 3 bricks

### 4-Debugger:
To utilize this debugger, first set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of a line of your code, just to the left of the line number. When you click there, you will see a red dot appearing. Imagine this as a stop sign, asking the compiler to pause such that you can consider whatâ€™s happening in this part of your code, by turning the dull red stop button to bright red once clicked

Second, run debug50 ./buggy0. You will notice that after the debugger comes to life that a line of your code will illuminate in a gold-like color. The code has paused at this line of code. Notice in the top left corner how all local variables are being displayed, including i, which has a current value of 0. At the top of your window, you can click the step over button and it will keep moving through your code. Notice how the value of i increases.
This tool will not show you where your bug is, it will help you slow down and see how your code is running step by step

Rubber duck debugging:

 When you are having challenges with your code, consider how speaking out loud to a rubber duck about the code problem.
